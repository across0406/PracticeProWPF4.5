- This WPF window relies on the following:
=> Window
=> Page ( similar to Window, but used for navigable applications. )
=> Application ( defines application resources and startup settings, but just being only one, there is nothing for application. )
- There are two XML namespaces:
=> xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
=> xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
